# TYPO3 extension `feedit`

This TYPO3 extension is a simple solution to allow a logged in backend user to
edit content elements of a TYPO3 page via the frontend. It inserts editing icons
around elements for this purpose, which redirect the user to the corresponding
content element form in the backend.
